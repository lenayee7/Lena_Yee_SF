				<h3 id="family">Family</h3>
				<p class="exerpt">My real name is Kathleen however I prefer to be called by my nickname Lena. I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii by my lovely mother & father Debby & Jeffrey Yee. I am the 2nd eldest of 4 siblings. Older brother, Winston, younger sister & brother, Kerrie & Jefferson. Winston & Kerrie are web developers currently working in San Francisco and youngest brother Jeffy works in the carpenter's union on Oahu.</p>
				<h3>College</h3>
				<p class="exerpt">In 2005, I attended St. John's University in Queens, NY where I played four years of volleyball and one year of soccer as a collegiate athlete. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Sports Mangement because of my passion for sports.</p>
				<h3>What I do for Fun</h3>
				<p class="exerpt">I like anything that involves being active & sweaty. I grew up in Hawaii playing indoor volelyball & soccer, however since I moved to Orange County, I've found a great passion for playing beach volleyball. Other workouts I enjoy are running, hiking & yoga. To balance out work outs, I like to satisfy my cravings for sweet things; experience different foods & explore new eateries. (Thank You Yelp!)myself to new places to eat on Yelp). And lastly, sometimes I just like to be lazy! </p>
